## WBS app (from wbs-dashboard-streamlit)

This folder is the standalone WBS extractor UI taken from the original project.

Run it separately from the main dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run wbs_app/wbs_app.py
```

The main dashboard/S-curve app lives at the repo root and runs with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Keep the two apps independent so each retains its own layout and theme.
